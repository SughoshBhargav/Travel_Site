            &emsp;&emsp; <strong>Mcleodganj</strong> an extension of a developed city - Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh, is a wonderful choice for some chilled out time in the Himalayas. 
            Once a popular hill-station in Himachal Pradesh, Dharamsala along with Mcleodganj, is slowly evolving into a hotspot for the expats, who have left their city-life to live in the Himalayas.
            Historically, Mcleodganj used to be a favourite summer destination for the officers serving at the Kangra cantonment during the British India rule and hence the name Dharamsala - meaning a "rest house". Later, when Dalai Lama took refuge in Mcleodganj, the hill station transformed into a Tibetan refugee centre and  Buddhist pilgrimage destination. 
            The mountainous region and  forests of Oak, Rhododendron, Deodar, and makes Mcleodganj a favorite trekkers.The towns of Dharamsala, Dharamkot, Bhagsu Nag and Kangra are some of the closest destinations to Mcleodganj.
